## Developing & contributing

### Installation

```sh
yarn
```

### Local Development

```sh
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window (<http://localhost:3000/>). Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
