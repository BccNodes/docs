# OKP4 NFT tutorial

> [Version fran√ßaise](./fr.md)

## Prerequisites

To thank you for investing in OKP4, the team has decided to offer you a unique [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)!

This NFT is part of a collection of 75 NFTs that represent the first SAFT edition. It is a proof of involvement in the project at its beginning. It has no legal value. It can be exchanged, and you are free to do what you want with it. It may or may not entitle you to future benefits.

This NFT is held in a personal [Stargaze](https://www.stargaze.zone/) address we created specifically for you. This address is controlled by a private key that takes the form of a [mnemonic](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase).

But nothing proves you that we will get rid of that private key once we shared it to you, you must transfer it to a wallet you created yourself.

This tutorial will help you find you're NFT and transfer it to your personal wallet.
