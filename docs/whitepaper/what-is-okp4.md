# OKP4 principles and features

## Goals & principles

Data intermediaries will be key players in the trillion dollar data sharing economy of tomorrow.
Decentralized data intermediaries will dominate centralized alternatives.

OKP4's goal is to be the leading decentralized data intermediary by enabling a new wave of innovation & use cases through unique coordination features.

To do that, we followed 7 principles to maximize opportunities and minimize risks & costs:

### Opportunity-maximization
Onboard builders, contributors and users to create new use cases and share value.

- **Design for builders**: to maximize adoption through valuable data applications. Builders will innovate and design Data Spaces & communities that will enable this wave of valuable data applications. OKP4 is then designed to facilitate on-boarding of builders though SDKs and docs, fast deployment through tools & templates, and community empowerment to create a thriving ecosystem.

- **Design for contributors**: to maximize value created by data application by onboarding contributors. Value-sharing models and easy to use tools will incentivize participants in infinite ways, encouraging them to share data, algorithms, storage and computation towards a common goal.

- **Design for freedom**: to maximize opportunities by aligning interest between providers, builders and users through freedom of innovation and customization.

- **Design for interoperability**: to maximize synergies at the blockchain level through cross-chain communication, at the ecosystem level thanks to agnosticity, and also at the Data Space level through interoperability of standards and governance synergies, and at the application level enabling applications to leverage multiple Data Spaces, or multiple applications leveraging the same Data Space.

### Risk-minimization
Let anyone build and contribute by minimizing trust and technical issues.

- **Design for sovereignty**: raw data is never stored on-chain. Some metadata is but only for features such as discoverability, value sharing & security. In some applications, data can be shared through privacy-preserving algorithms to provide a valuable output without transfering the data to another particupant/user. That way, data providers can be rewarded without any risk of losing sovereignty over their data.
- **Design for trustlessness**: every rule, rights and governance mechanism can be enforced on-chain by the decentralized network of validators. Coordination between providers (data, algorithms, storage, computation), builders, users, curators and governance participants is autonomous, fluid and unstoppable.

### Cost-minimization

- **Design for minimal extraction**: no intermediary, only an open digital infrastructure that doesn't seek value-extraction. Its scalable and dedicated nature makes it unlikely to be congested and/or expensive. This app-specific network is supported by incentivized nodes enabling low fees for anyone.

## Key functionalities & features

### Generic

OKP4 is a general-purpose communication infrastructure that enables XaaS - Anything as a Service. The protocol enable anyone to share any data, any algorithm, any storage, any cloud, any SSI, etc. Anyone can earn from these assets and services and make them valuable for the community.

### Customizable

Besides WHAT you can share, OKP4 is highly customizible in terms of HOW you can share. Smart contracts that govern Data Space can be copied, edited, reinvented in infinite ways. Customization is applied to the rules (business models, access mechanisms, constraints on service providers...) and also the mechanisms to change the rules (who can vote, weight of their vote, fixed or dynamic through a token, etc).

### Scalable
Its generic infrastructure makes it scalable by design, as workflow orchestration, computation and storage is done off-chain and is theoretically unlimited. Nevertheless, indexation, rule enforcement, governance and value-sharing is done on-chain. With a capacity of 10 000TPS, limits may be reached when dozens to hundreds of highly used data apps coexist on the OKP4 ecosystem. That is one of the reasons a roll-up strategy is implemented to enable layer-2 scalability and even more roll-up-specific functionalities (such as on-chain privacy features).

### Decentralized
The OKP4 network has no trusted parties or single points of failure for any function. Many centralized components can intervene in data workflows but are not mandatory. As said before, the infrastructure is generic and its thriving ecosystem will be composed of many centralized & decentralized independent components.
OKP4 blockchain is decentralized thanks to the Tendermint consensus and many validator nodes that find consensus on the state of the network. Its governance is also decentralized through a DAO. Eventually, as with every PoS networks and token-based DAOs, its decentralization is dependant on the distribution of the token and the ability of one stakeholder to acquire a "dangerous" stake in the network. Eventally, it all comes down to the value and liquidity of its token on the market. The more distributed and expensive to acquire the token is, the more it can be and stay decentralized.

### Permissionless
Anyone can become a validator, delegator, governance participant, data, algorithm, storage and computation provider, builder, curator or user. Some Data Spaces may be restricted on the user & provider sides, but the infrastructure will always be open and permissionless, ensuring censorship-resistance at the foundation of the technology stack.

### Secure
OKP4 is designed for security at the blockchain level (due to its decentralized nature and robust consensus mechanism), but also at the data level. The blockchain enforces rules such as access control that are immutable (except if consensus is reached to change these rules of course). That way, vulnerability will never be on the blockchain side, but on the user/provider side (if there's a breach in his own cloud infrastructure for a self-hosted data provider, or if a user gets his private keys stolen for exemple).

### Complex workflows
A user/builder can design complex workflows such as thousands of datasets interact with hundreds of services to produce a single product or application. A set of tools is provided to enable anyone to easily build such workflows and innovate on how data can be used and shared trustlessly.

### Synergetic
OKP4 is modular in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of governance. While the blockchain is as decentralized as possible, the Data Spaces and resources that interact through it may have centralized components and governance. This enables web2 and web3 synergies with quick-coordination, human-centric UI while keeping web3 strengths such as data sovereignty, tokenized governance, powerful incentives, trustlessness, auditability... OKP4 is then an open infrastructure that suits needs on a spectrum from decentralized communities to private businesses, with many hybrid models and synergies to build and discover.

### Incentivized
To ensure that high-value applications can rely on the network to keep all of its functionalities listed above, OKP4 inventivizes validators, delegators, providers, curators, builders to ensure development, maintenance, involvement into the ecosystem. Incentives are designed to align individual interest with public interest through low inflation, fair value distribution and punishment of detrimental behaviors.

## Concepts & definitions

2 key concepts to understand:

**Data Space**: Abstraction that comprises

- Bundle of rights & rules that regulates interactions between data, tokens and any service (storage, algorithms, computation...) shared by participants
- Governance mechanisms to adapt these rights and rules

In a Data Space, datasets and algorithms are not stored centrally but at source and are therefore only shared (via semantic interoperability) when necessary. Data Spaces can be nested and overlapping, so that a data provider, for example, can participate in several Data Spaces at once without the need to copy or move his data.

**Dataverse**: Endless combination of interoperable, sometimes nested and overlapping Data Spaces where participants, assets and resources can interact and be used in applications.

And many more definitions:

**Crowdsource data**: Build a large pool of shared data from individuals.

**Dataset**: A collection of related sets of information* that is composed of separate elements but can be manipulated as a unit by a computer. They can be video files, images, texts, sounds, statistics, algorithms weights, source code.

**Data lake**: A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semi structured, and unstructured data.

**Data silos**: A data silo is a repository of data that's controlled by one party and is isolated from the rest. It is typically stored in a standalone system and often is incompatible with other data sets. While "data silos" is a term usually used to only talk about data inside an organization, we use it also to qualify data that does not provide value outside the organization.

**Information**: Contextualized, aggregated and interpreted data.

**Knowledge**: Output from data sharing that is used and valuable for the end-user.

**SDK**: A Software Development Kit is a set of developments tools that facilitate the creation of applications on a platform.

**Trustless data sharing**: To let data contribute to valuable knowledge and applications without ever losing control of the data itself, through a trustless network and privacy-preserving techniques so that other parties never access the raw shared data.
