# Utility token

According to the adopted business model, KNOW tokens are at the center of our economy. Indeed, they allow first of all to pay for the creation of knowledge as well as to remunerate all contributors to the creation of this knowledge (data, algorithms and resource providers). At the center of our ecosystem, this token will be used to pay the transaction fees on the blockchain and to remunerate the network validators.
