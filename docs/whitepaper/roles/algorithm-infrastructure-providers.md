# Algorithm & Infrastructure Providers

Algorithms & Infrastructure providers are members of the community who have deposited and are able to run what is called a service. A service can be an algorithm, a processing software, a tool... requiring a processing time. They are paid by the builders on an hourly rate that they define themselves according to the duration of use.

It is particularly recommended to deposit quality algorithms & infrastructure softwares, on the one hand because it will be much more likely to be used many times (and to be well curated), on the other hand it will give the provider a well known reputation that he can use in his favor for other deposits or if he decides to curate.

The provider will be able to create a descriptive page for his repository at any time. However, in order for a builder to be able to invoke and use this algorithm/infrastructure, he will have to stake KNOW in proportion to the hourly fee that he will define himself.
