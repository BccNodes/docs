# Data Providers

Data providers are members of the community who have deposited one or more datasets in the catalog and/or in one or more data spaces. Their role is to offer datasets in order to give the possibility to builders to create new knowledges. 

They are paid by the builders for each use of their data set.

It is particularly recommended to deposit quality datasets, on the one hand because it will be much more likely to be used many times (and to be well curated), on the other hand it will give the provider a well known reputation that he can use in his favor for other deposits or if he decides to curate.
