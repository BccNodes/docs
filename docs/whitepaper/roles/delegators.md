# Delegators

Delegators are KNOW holders who cannot, or do not want to, run a validator node themselves. They can delegate KNOW to a validator and obtain a part of their revenue in exchange.

Delegators share revenue with their validators, but they also share risks. If a validator does not respect the described rules, he and each of his delegators will be partially deducted in proportion to their delegated stake. This is why each delegator must be careful about which validator they choose before deciding to delegate. It is possible to dillute the level of risk by delegating to several validators.

Delegators play en essential role in the system since they are responsible for the selection of validators; they therefore play an active role in the ecosystem. They must actively monitor the actions of their validators and participate in governance.

About the governance of the DAO, the delegators give their voting power automatically to the validators to whom they delegate their tokens. However, if they wish to vote by themselves, they can manually "retrieve" the right to vote on their share of tokens and vote normally.
