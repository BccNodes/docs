### Curation Markets

With the establishment of curation markets in OKP4 ecosystem, a whole new world of possibilities will be opening up. The new opportunity to participate in the network as a curator comes with many exciting adventures but also with potential risks.

What are curation markets?

A curation market is a model allowing actors in a network to effectively coordinate around shared goals, this is accomplished by coordinating the work around a token that is minted to incentivize specific results (they earn from the value they co-create). Curation markets are specifically designed to reduce information asymmetries and to curate valuable information.

Decentralized Coordination of Labor and Capital: The establishment of curation markets allows network participants to mint and burn tokens (named shares) in accordance with predefined rules without involving a centralized third party. The process of creating these tokens of value is not controlled by a specific entity. Instead, the bonding curve contract of the curation market is responsible for distributing (minting) the shares.

Core Components of Curation Markets:
- Continuous: shares (tokens) can be minted and burned any time without time constraints
- Autonomous: bonding curve contracts calculate token prizes autonomously
- Communal: a communal deposit is created to keep the amount paid for minted tokens
- Proportional: curators curate information with their proportional backing of tokens bonded to them

### Curators

Curators do not need to possess complex technical skills or knowledge. All it takes is the ability to do transactions via Keplr. Similarly, Curators are not required to stake a minimum amount of KNOW. Depending on the individual's risk tolerance, Curation may be especially attractive for those who are able to accurately evaluate items and have a good understanding of Web3 and of the underlying mechanics of bonding curves.

In order for builders and Data Spaces to simply find an item, it must first be ranked. Ranking is a process in which items are put in competition with each other so that they can be found more quickly and it's easier to place trust in them. 

Thus, if users had to guess which items to use, they would be less likely to find quality items on the first try. This is where curators comes in.

Curators are essential to the decentralized economy on our protocol. They use their knowledge and common sense to analyze items to identify which ones are of the highest quality and which ones are likely to be used the most. Through the catalog, Curators can visualize the entirety of what is available in order to make signaling decisions and invest in it. 

These people will be rewarded by earning a portion of the rewards that datasets and services generate. Curation is about identifying valuable pieces of information in a data stream (or in a service) and presenting it to the target audience in a way that adds value (mainly visibility and trust). 

OKP4 uses curation as an incentive mechanism to encourage network participants to identify items of a high-quality and to foster information sharing in the ecosystem.
The curator role is ideal for all those that wish to become more active in the network than just being a Delegator. They can be community members, data consumers, developers, item providers...

When signaling, Curators can decide to signal a specific version of a dataset/service, or they can decide to use automatic migration through updates to new versions. If you decide to signal on a specific version, despite the update, your shares will always remain on that specific version.

Curation is risky. Do your due diligence to ensure that you only curate datasets and services that you trust. A detailed list of the different risks is available in the token model section.

### Auto-Curation Priority

Any provider can stake KNOW tokens on their data/service as a curation to oneself. It follows the same rules as any curator. The only change is that the provider will always have the first hand before the others.

Data & Algorithm/Infrastructure Operation: When the provider will deposit his dataset/service, he will have to choose if he accepts or not the curators. If he has accepted them, when he makes his dataset/service available for use, the provider can, if he wants, buy shares before anyone else. 

Once the first purchase is made, the burn & mint system opens to the whole community. The provider who curates will of course receive the associated rewards, in proportion to his number of shares (at the very beginning if he is alone, he will receive 100% of the curation royalties).

#faire un petit cadre#
Note: The first address to signal a particular item is considered the first curator and will have to do much more gas-intensive work than the rest of the following curators because the first curator initializes the curation share tokens, initializes the bonding curve, and also transfers tokens into OKP4 proxy.
