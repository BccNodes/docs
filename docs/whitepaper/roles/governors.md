# Governors

The ideal we imagine and wish for is a Dataverse filled with Data Spaces, each with its own operating model (rules) and each with its own governance token. However, we know that in some cases, especially in the context of a small restricted Data Space or in a private Data Space for example, this solution is not the most adequate for the participants. 

This is why we have decided to let each Data Space choose between different governance options:
- Governance via a newly created token. This token will have value, a market...
- Governance via whitelist. The creators of the Data Space will be able to choose themselves which wallet will have the right to vote, what is the voting weight per wallet, if there is the possibility to add/remove people from the list or if they don't want the list to change...
- Governance via KNOW token. 
- Under development, the possibility to have a governance token from other chains (ETH, BNB...)

As an example, it will be able to add fees for the use of its Data Space in order to create or develop a treasury; because each Data Space can have its own treasury if needed.
