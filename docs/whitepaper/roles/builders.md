# Builders

Builders are members of the community who will consume/use the resources given by the data providers and by the algorithm & infrastructure providers in order to create one or more knowledge.

They are the ones who will pay in KNOW tokens for the data sets and services used.

Overall, they are the ones who are behind the creation of the Data Spaces (with of course the participation of all stakeholders). However, they can also decide to build on an existing Data Space.
