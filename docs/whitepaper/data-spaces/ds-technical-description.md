# Data Space Technical description

The OKP4 protocol allows to build highly customized Data Spaces and to manage them. 

Thanks to the OKP4 development kit, anyone can create and design Data Space with as much freedom as possible. This development kit comprises Rulebook templates and no-code tools to set the governance rules. 

:::tip  
OKP4 Development Kit is designed to give as much freedom as possible for developers, data scientists and communities at large. Freedom of development, freedom of business models, freedoms of standards... freedom of innovation.

:::

The Rulebook describes a set of rules, standards and tools based on 5 pillars: ethics, legal, data management, technical requirements & business models.

Once the Data Space is created through the Development Kit, it is encoded in Prolog language in a smart contract. Prolog is a logic programming language.
 
For each transaction sent to the OKP4 blockchain, the protocol checks that every rule of every Data Space is respected. Otherwise, the transaction canâ€™t be validated.
