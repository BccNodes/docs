# DS Governance

Data Spaces are commons governed in a decentralized way. 

The governance of a data space details who can participate and the membership mechanisms. 
It is possible to create roles with restricted rights.  

The governance precises the nature public, private (or even secret) of a Data Space. A public Data Space is reachable by anybody and a private one needs mechanisms of invitation or request of adhesion.

Besides, each Data Space decides what are the governance mechanism to change the rules. For instance, it can be a process of proposition and vote by all the members of the Data Space. 

Note that the decentralized governance of the OKP4 protocol still allows users to create centralized Data Spaces. Indeed, the governance of a DS can be in the hands of one or several chosen or elected members. 

:::note

In a nutshell, the governance of a Data Space defines the following : 
-	Nature of the Data Space (public, private, secret)
-	Nature of participants
-	Conditions of access to the Data Space
-	Mechanisms to change the rules
