# Purpose of Data Spaces

Data Spaces are ecosystems for the seamless sharing of data and services that interact according to common governance rules, guaranteeing the trust and interest of stakeholders in contributing. These Data Spaces are the source of new value chains in the knowledge economy.

A Data Space is an abstraction that comprises:

- Bundle of rights & rules that regulates interactions between data, algorithms and resources shared by participants,
- Governance mechanisms to adapt these rules

A Data Space is highly customizable to allow its members to create a space of sharing designed exactly as they need. The Rulebook describes a set of rules, standards and tools shared with Data Space participants, based on 5 pillars: ethics, legal, data management, technical requirements & business models.

Added by the features of the OKP4 ecosystem, the customized Data Space’s governance brings confidence and also widens the scope of possibilities to innovate with economic models to align participants’ interest.  

Several Data Spaces can have participants, data and algorithms in common and are in fact overlapping. We call Dataverse the endless combination of interoperable Data Spaces where participants, assets and resources can interact freely.
