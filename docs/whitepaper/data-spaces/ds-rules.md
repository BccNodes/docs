# Data Space Rules

A Data Space comprises a bundle of rights & rules that regulates interactions between data, algorithms and resources shared by participants. 

The rules can refer to data management, retribution and business model or technical requirements for instance. All the rules are totally customizable. 

## Examples of rules

**Data management**
- All metadata of datasets and services must be described
- Restrictions on the licence of the dataset
- Only one type of actors has access to the raw data

**Technical requirements** 
- Each data provider stores its own data 

**Business models**
- Retribution of the contributors according to the template XXX : Open data are not retributed and other datasets are retributed in function of the service consumption
- Retribution of the contributor according to the template “Data Marketplace” : each provider evaluate the price of its data or services. 

Governance mechanisms allow to adapt these rules (See next section).
