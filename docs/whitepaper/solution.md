# Solution

## OKP4 Overview

:::caution

This chapter is non-technical, suited to explain the concepts. The next chapter will dive into technical design.

:::

### General Purpose

**Offering a unique Solution to Digital Resource Sharing Challenges:**

OKP4 provides a **decentralized, open, public, censorship-resistant, and neutral infrastructure**, empowering everyone to harness the complete potential of digital resources for knowledge creation. It's a **flexible and expressive protocol** designed to facilitate the sharing of data and service to create knowledge among diverse stakeholders. The protocol aims to bridge the gaps between existing Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 solutions by integrating their respective strengths at various levels and enabling their interoperability.

**Democratizing Data and Knowledge Access:**

OKP4 democratizes access to data and knowledge by **breaking down silos and promoting collaboration**. It aims to create economic incentives and fair compensation models that encourage data and knowledge sharing. The protocol's design allows for a **framework and rules** based on an **immutable and auditable truth layer**, providing an unquestionable source of reliability. It offers **flexible governance mechanisms** that allow all participants to benefit from each other's interests, thereby fostering a win-win scenario.

**Enabling the orchestration of shared resources:**

A key mission of OKP4 is to unlock new value chains, thus spreading awareness and educating the world about the importance of knowledge sharing in fostering innovation and evolution.

To achieve these objectives, OKP4 is designed as **a protocol layer optimized for trust-minimized knowledge sharing**. As an open, interoperable infrastructure, it encourages resource sharing, and the creation of **highly customized rules, governance mechanisms, and business models, aligning interests** among participants and facilitating the construction of useful distributed applications.

### OKP4 concepts

At a high level, OKP4 protocol aims at interconnecting off-chain resources with customized rules and governance which are recorded in the immutable source of trust. This allows everyone to build specific applications leveraging shared data and algorithms through a sustainable settlement layer.

![P2-01](/img/content/whitepaper/P2-01.webp)

There are several parts to distinguish:

- Immutable source of truth and trust: **Blockchain layer - Consensus Layer**
- Open interoperable solution to share resources and define rules to orchestrate them: **Protocol layer**
- Off-chain resources: **Dataverse**
- Valuable applications using resources shared through the protocol: **Use Cases**

Let's do an overview of the different parts of the protocol and their purposes in the architecture

![P2-02](/img/content/whitepaper/P2-02.webp)

OKP4 blockchain enables a new generation of **hybrid on & off-chain applications**. It is a sector-specific blockchain designed for resource-sharing & coordination (datasets, algorithms, storage, computation...).

**The Blockchain Layer: Fundamental Base of OKP4:**

The OKP4 blockchain layer, a public distributed ledger, acts as **a vital settlement layer**, validating and recording Protocol Layer actions. As an open smart contract platform, it offers tools for unique application creation. Its operation is upheld by independent validators using the KNOW token, reinforcing system integrity. Governance lies with the community of token holders, signifying its decentralized nature. Built on the Cosmos SDK using the Tendermint algorithm, this Proof of Stake chain is specifically designed to best suit the protocol’s needs.

**The Protocol Layer: Core of OKP4's Operation:**

The Protocol Layer constitutes **the heart of OKP4**, offering an open, interoperable space tailored for any resources, customized rules, governance mechanisms, and business models. This fosters interest alignment among participants and supports the development of useful applications based on shared resources. With its permissionless design, it encourages builders to innovate, providers to share, consumers to use, and users to reap benefits, while facilitating coordination for knowledge creation.

**Dataverse: The Digital Environment:**

The Dataverse is the **repository of digital resources indexed** and described through the protocol, encompassing datasets, algorithms, storage, computation, and workflow engines etc… Anything digital can be shared and referenced in the Dataverse, enabling Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS). The Dataverse serves as the off-chain environment orchestrated by the Protocol, where all actions are triggered on-chain, according to the rules.

**Applications: Realizing Use Cases:**

Applications represent **the endpoint use cases** enabled by the Protocol Layer's diverse services - resource availability, governance, and decentralized orchestration. Builders can create applications consuming the resources of the Dataverse, interfacing with end-users, underlining the protocol's practical application and value creation.

## OKP4 Blockchain Layer

### Blockchain General Purpose

**Why does OKP4 protocol need a blockchain layer ?**

As a decentralized orchestrator of digital resources, OKP4 needs a blockchain infrastructure for essential reasons:

- Verifying and validating the Protocol Layer events thanks to decentralized consensus mechanism
- Ensuring an immutable and auditable registration of settlements for the Protocol Layer
- Enabling highly customized settlements to coordinate participants and resources through rules enforcement and value exchange

![P2-03](/img/content/whitepaper/P2-03.webp)

As the basis of the architecture, the blockchain will serve as **a source of truth and trust** to build our protocol on top of that. It responds to two of our challenges:

- Decentralization
- Openness

![p2-04](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-04.webp)

Thanks to the public blockchain solution, OKP4 seeks to state as a **permissionless, trustless and censorship resistant protocol** where anyone can verify all the events in a sustainable and immutable ledger.

### Specific App-Chain for Knowledge

The traditional blockchain architecture is ideally suited for database management due to the canonical nature of transactions, as well as the advantages offered by its distributed ledger, which essentially functions as a form of triple-entry accounting.

Nevertheless, due to the complex and fragmented nature of our domain and its governance aspect, we need an architecture that is **more interoperable and expressive**. The OKP4 protocol has to allow any digital resources to **be understandable and interoperable** with the protocol. Furthermore, given the dynamic nature of the data and knowledge field, it's crucial that the OKP4 protocol possesses scalability to accommodate future growth and changes.

For this, we need a specific design **(modularity)** to be able to interconnect and interpret resources of various nature **(interoperability)**

![p2-05](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-05.webp)

**What design for OKP4 Protocol ?**

The OKP4 blockchain is a public delegated proof-of-stake layer 1 built with the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main).

*Cosmos in a nutshell:*

*Cosmos is an application-specific blockchain (ASB)  ecosystem. It offers the ability for anyone to build their own sovereign ASB which is able to easily communicate with other blockchains. For its philosophy and its characteristics of sovereignty, modularity and interoperability, OKP4 is part of the Cosmos ecosystem.*

The Cosmos stack is composed of three modular elements:

**Tendermint Core:** This is an application-agnostic consensus engine used to manage the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain. Essentially, it's the software that securely replicates the state of a ledger or a virtual machine across all network nodes. Tendermint Core embodies the low-level components necessary to operate a blockchain, including peer-to-peer networking, consensus algorithm, mempool, and everything below the application layer.

**Cosmos SDK:** This open-source development kit allows the easy creation of a blockchain from a set of modules. In practice, **these modules** and their configurations provide specificity to the Protocol Layer. Several modules catering to generic functionalities, such as account management, staking, and token management, are provided within the Cosmos GitHub repository. This arrangement frees application developers to focus on designing modules that cater to their unique needs, instead of worrying about fulfilling the fundamental requirements of a blockchain.

**IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication):** [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/) is a general-purpose messaging protocol designed for communication between IBC-enabled blockchains. It's implemented through a specific module that ensures reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication. The IBC fosters an environment of interoperability, allowing distinct blockchains to interact seamlessly, thus enhancing the overall scalability and utility of the network.

![P2-06](/img/content/whitepaper/P2-06.webp)

The idea behind this architecture is to use a generic consensus engine (Tendermint Core) and build an application layer by combining modules (Cosmos SDK) and creating specific design for specific use cases. Then, IBC module enables any sovereign blockchain to communicate.

**What does OKP4 need a specific app-chain ?**

As we saw in the introduction, when we touch on the field of knowledge, we must take into account an **aspect of semantics, of conceptualization of off-chain resources** indexed on the protocol. The architecture of our blockchain must meet this primary need for **interpretability and expressiveness**.

Moreover, the need for **flexibility and guarantees** on governance mechanisms reinforces our choice of an architecture oriented towards modularity, interoperability and expressiveness.

The OKP4 blockchain uses the classic stack of Cosmos SDK modules to manage the canonical aspect of the blockchain. In particular, OKP4 integrates the WASM module to create CosmWasm smart contracts. *We’ll give more technical details about the module in the dedicated part (IV).*

Our task is to **build specific modules and smart contracts** tailored for OKP4.

![p2-07](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-07.webp)

## OKP4 Protocol Architecture

### Architecture overview

Given the robustness of our customizable and decentralized infrastructure, one may wonder:

What are the implications and applications of such a system?

More specifically, why is it essential to have interoperability and modularity built into our infrastructure?

![p2-08](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-08.webp)

In order to build an open interoperable infrastructure for highly customized rules and governance mechanisms leveraged by a trust minimized resource sharing layer, we need to:

- Allow anyone to be able to **reference and describe digital resources,** and attach their **own rules to it** (consent, price…)
- Allow anyone to find, use and combine resources according to predefined rules or new ones (as long as it's compliant with resource-specific rules)
- Ensure that every action is initiated with the boundaries of the rules, and that every resource provider has done what was asked from him.

In order to fully understand the scope of its objectives and the design choice for the protocol, let us illustrate with a few examples:

![p2-09](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-09.webp)

In this illustration, we identify three distinct digital resources:

- An anonymized health dataset (depicted in red) from a hospital
- A cloud computing service (illustrated in green)
- A predictive analysis algorithm (colored in blue) designed to detect cancer risks
- ...

These resources, when synergistically combined, could enable us to extract valuable insights from the dataset, potentially aiding in cancer risk detection in patients and thereby enriching our understanding in the fight against cancer. However, it is essential to recognize that each of these resources has its **own rules and governance mechanisms**.

The varied nature of these rules often leads to **complex logical deductions** and numerous inferences. For instance, one of the rules of the green service depends on the number of tokens staked: the service costs 5 KNOW per hour or is free for those staking a minimum of 200 KNOW.

Moreover, the protocol has to expressively understand the existing dependance and establish hierarchies between the logic rules and the different entities.

Then, the execution conditions of a new workflow involving these resources could exist based on criteria external to the resources themselves. To illustrate this, consider a second scenario:

![p2-10](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-10.webp)

Suppose a public administration of a country decides to combine the green and blue services to offer a new service, complete with its own rules and governance. It opts to provide this service free of charge to all public administrations within the same country.

In this case, the rules of the new service (let's call it the 'orange' service) must still comply with the rules of the two services it utilizes (green and blue). Moreover, if the green service decides to modify its consent rules, the protocol must be able to interpret these changes to consistently resolve the complexities of logical deductions.

So, what can we deduce from these scenarios?

- The complexity of the rules demands a **high-performance logical deduction** engine.
- It's imperative for the blockchain layer to interpret these mechanisms to maintain an **understandable source of truth**.
- Execution guarantees are needed so that **execution proceeds smoothly** despite the combination of various on-chain/off-chain events, rules, and resources of diverse natures.

![p2-11](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-11.webp)

Thus, to ensure decentralized governance infrastructure for off-chain digital resources, we identify three fundamental criterias:

- Establishing a trust framework governance and rules = **LAW**
- Facilitating interpretability and interoperability = **ONTOLOGY**
- Guaranteeing successful execution = **DECENTRALIZED ORCHESTRATION**

**Our value proposition:**

The OKP4 protocol leverages the blockchain layer to construct digital commons, termed **Zones**, where digital resources can be shared with **customizable rules** concerning every facet of resource sharing. This includes aspects such as access control, data and service management, business models, governance frameworks for instance.The OKP4 protocol ensures proper compliance with the rules and the execution.

### Architecture and Zone Overview

The primary objective of Zones is to facilitate the coordination of heterogeneous systems and resources. Zones aim to integrate all systems, both on-chain and off-chain.

**What is a Zone ?**

A Zone is a conceptual framework defined by a set of rules, within which the recognized digital resources are compatible with these rules, taking into account the associated consents. Thus, the recognition of resources within a Zone relies on the dynamic evaluation of the conformity of the rules and consents of the resources. There is no materialized link that determines the belonging of a resource to a Zone since the rules and consents express conditions that constantly evolve over time.

![p2-12](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-12.webp)

Another way to perceive it is through the rules of the Zone. The existence of these rules defines the reality of the Zone, and it is through the consideration (evaluation) of digital resources that are compatible with the Zone that the extent of the Zone's territory is defined. In other words, the rules establish the boundaries and parameters that determine which digital resources fall within the Zone and are recognized as part of it. By evaluating the compatibility of resources with the Zone's rules, the scope and coverage of the Zone can be determined. Multiple Zones may share common resources and can be nested or overlapped, based on the rules associated with each resource and zone.

There is then an endless combination of oftentimes interoperable Zones where participants and digital resources can interact freely and create value.

![p2-13](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-13.webp)

**Why no link between Zone and resources?**

If there is no materialized link determining the belonging of a resource to a Zone, it is because Zones are designed to adapt to constantly evolving rules and conditions that continuously redefine their boundaries.

In a way, this is quite similar to Adaptive Systems, which are systems that adjust to changes in their environment. In the case of the Zone, the environment is the set of all possible digital resources, and the Adaptation is the re-evaluation of which resources belong to a Zone as the rules, consents and context change.

Anyone can initiate workflows (interaction of datasets and services according to the rules within a Zone) generating new outputs.

![p2-14](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-14.webp)

These outputs created from different shared resources within a Zone can feed any application. These applications are not part of the Zone and have their governance. They can be either Web 2.0 or Web 3.0 applications.

**To sum up:**

This conceptualization of the zone protocol allows us to easily meet the need for **flexibility and integrity** of digital resources. However, the stones must be shaped to allow this:

- Gouvernance aspect
- interpretability and expressivity
- Decentralized execution

OKP4 protocol has to allow the specific design for these issues.

## Protocol functionality

Before diving into the specific design, it is important to distinguish what we build and what we re-use thanks to the Cosmos stacks.

![p2-16](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-16.webp)

*NB: As native code is integrated into the blockchain, the modules are represented at the level of the blockchain layer.*

*Smart contracts are represented between the protocol layer and the settlement layer because their entities could be represented in both in the conceptual point of view.*

### Creating and Managing Zones

![p2-17](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-17.webp)

As an open protocol, anyone can create their own Zones using the dedicated smart contracts that we are developing.

A combination of smart contracts adeptly manages all the essential components required for effective Zone management:

- Zone creation
- Management of governance rules
- Governance of the Zone itself

Given the logical complexity required to effectively manage areas and resources, as well as their associated rules, it is preferable to segregate tasks into different smart contracts for specific purposes.

We will delve into the specifics of these smart contracts in the dedicated section (IV).

What is important to understand in the management of zones is that the implementation of specific smart contracts enables management of all the essential components. In addition, the integrity of the state of a Zone, its rules (same for resources) will be ensured by the blockchain layer.

### Interpreting the rules

![p2-18](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-18.webp)

In a decentralized and autonomous system, the system must ensure that its rules are upheld consistently and universally.

Zones are predominantly characterized by their governance rules: how can interoperate in a Zone, which services can be incorporated, what actions can be performed within this Zone, and under what conditions, among other factors.

The protocol must facilitate a broad spectrum of possibilities in terms of governance and consent rules. It's essential to comprehend that within a Dataverse filled with digital resources, each with their own rules and laws, the combination of multiple resources can lead to complex logical scenarios.

A mechanism for representing logical principles and determining their validity based on specific contexts is necessary.

From a computer science perspective, the challenge lies in resolving occasionally complex logical problems among the different rules. This includes notions of hierarchy, inconsistency, dependency, and conflict resolution in terms of access, etc.

To tackle this, OKP4 aims at providing a reliable and secure mechanism to ensure that all the invoked rules are correctly interpreted in a decentralized way.

Each Zone carries the responsibility of consulting the rules to determine whether the action that the user wishes to perform is legitimate or not, given the rules established within the Zone. This consideration must also take into account different contexts at the time of the request, as the state of the blockchain evolves.

![p2-19](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-19.webp)

1 - The user wants to interact with a Zone

2 - The Zone ask to the dedicated smart contract if its possible given the context and all the involved rules

3- The Law process employs logical inference to resolve matters based on the state of the blockchain

4 - The Law process yields a modality as a response, such as "prohibited", "permitted", "possible", and so on.  

Depending on the answer, the execution process could start.

We will delve into this mechanism in the technical section (IV)

### Interpreting the protocol concept - Ontology

![p2-20](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-20.webp)

With the smart contracts managing the zones and the logic module, the OKP4 protocol is able to provide a flexible and resilient framework to enable the exploitation of digital resources.

However, in view of the different natures and dependencies between the different concepts relating to the protocol (zone, resources, rules etc ...), it is necessary to express as clearly as possible the context, the meaning of the concepts and their relationships.

**Why is it important ?**

![p2-21](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-21.webp)

As we have deeply developed in the introduction, to really leverage the power of knowledge, it is necessary to develop a universal language taking into account the semantic aspect of each concept.

Let’s take an illustration to clearly understand.

![p2-22](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-22.webp)

The structural language only gives a definition of concept in a wide range. However, the semantic language could give the meaning of concepts, properties, relationships and entities.

The expressiveness of the language enhances the disambiguation and the interoperability between entities in a computable form.

To give meaning to each concept and entities in the protocole, we’ve decided to encode an ontology to represent and persist the information on the blockchain.

**Ontology overview:**

The conceptualization aspect, the ontology tries to explain the being itself by developing a system of universal categories and their intrinsic relationships. In computer science, ontology is an explicit and formal specification of a shared conceptualization

In OKP4 Protocol, our Ontology makes it possible to **model a semantic network of all entities** (zone, data, services, rules, processing workflows, etc.) by semantically characterizing what they are and the relationships they maintain between them.

The OKP4 ontology is stored on-chain as a smart contract, which called Cognitarium. Storing the on-chain ontology ensures the expressiveness and understanding of the protocol work in a formal way

![p2-24](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-24.webp)

The image above shows a schematic representation that the OKP4 ontology could take.

**What are the benefits for OKP4 Protocol ?**

The concept of storing ontology on the blockchain and leveraging it to imbue resources and datasets with meaning carries significant implications for both execution and verification.

**Execution:**

Providing a shared semantic framework within the protocol brings advantages in terms of standardization and interoperability among resources. Resources of various types can interconnect while understanding each other's roles, promoting cohesive integration and functional collaboration within the system.

**Interpretability & Representation:**

Ontology also provides a comprehensive and dynamic understanding of data sets within a Zone, their transformation (by services), and the applicable governance rules (data sharing, consents, policy rules). From this perspective, it delivers the data lineage (enabling traceability) for each piece of data within the Zones during various treatments, culminating in a knowledge graph of all data within the Dataverse.

In addition to serving as an immutable source of truth, the blockchain will provide detailed insight into the knowledge generation process, thereby qualifying itself as an interpretable settlement layer.

Below, an illustration of a workflow representation in the form of a knowledge graph, generated thanks to the information stored on-chain.

![p2-25](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-25.webp)

**An example:**

*Let's imagine there exists a Zone dedicated to medical research on a specific disease. This Zone includes multiple datasets from various hospitals and laboratories, along with several services for analyzing this data (for instance, machine learning algorithms for identifying biomarkers or predicting health outcomes).*

*The OKP4 ontology can precisely describe these entities and their interrelations. For instance, it can denote that that some services might depend on the results of other services.*

*With the aid of this ontology, researchers, hospitals, laboratories, and other stakeholders can readily understand the structure of this Zone and how they might utilize it. They could identify which datasets are available, what services they can employ, and how these services are interconnected.*

*Moreover, thanks to the OKP4 ontology stored on-chain, they can be assured that this information is accurate and up-to-date. For instance, if a new hospital contributes a fresh dataset to this Zone, the ontology will be updated on the blockchain, and all stakeholders will be able to observe this update and understand how this new dataset integrates into the Zone.*

*Finally, if an issue arises (for example, if a service's results are not as expected), the ontology on the blockchain can assist in retracing the steps that led to this problem, ensuring transparency and accountability.*

### Decentralized Execution

![p2-26](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-26.webp)

We are currently able to create highly customizable "commons" in terms of resources, governance, and usage rules. We can finely interpret the resources, their meaning, properties, and so forth.

However, at present, we only have a fully customizable "descriptive" framework and a universal communication language to read and understand the resources - making them machine understandable.

In the context of a decentralized orchestration protocol, we also need to orchestrate the execution of the workflow in a decentralized manner. This presents a significant challenge due to the many connections, interactions, and dependencies that exist in both on-chain and off-chain environments.

The challenge here is to ensure that all the events of the protocol are executed in a reliable environment so that all parties involved see their conditions respected with a trust minimized process.

To execute all the workflow while ensuring composability and integrity, we decided to implement a Service Execution Agreement in the form of a smart contract which called PACTUM

![p2-27](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-27.webp)

**How does the Pactum smart contract work ?**

When a user wishes to engage a workflow with a Zone, a service execution agreement as a Pactum smart contract will be established among the involved participants.

1. This agreement verifies the alignment of governance rules of the Zone and the digital resources involved in the execution and also checks the conformity of all rules within the entire execution context. This context includes the resources and the Zone, as well as the user who initiated the workflow.
2. It then oversees the entire execution flow of all the resources.
3. Lastly,the Pactum smart contract is able to apply retribution rules, ensuring distribution of rewards or compensation in accordance with defined retribution rules.

Concretely, it will serve as a decentralized orchestrator for the proper execution of protocol services and to manage cases of error.

## Dataverse

The Dataverse is an ever-expanding universe comprised of all the Datasets, Algorithms, Softwares, Infrastructures, Identity solutions, Workflow Engines, and other resources referenced in the Blockchain.

While resources in the Dataverse are classified as "off-chain resources," it is crucial to note that these can encompass **centralized or decentralized** solutions, or even services with decentralized governance.

![p2-28](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-28.webp)

Zones can be nested and overlapping, as one dataset can participate in many Zones, and many applications can be built on top of one Zone. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts: this is the Dataverse. All the digital resources indexed on the protocol have to register information on the blockchain to ensure the proper processing of the resources by the different entities of the protocol (ontology, logic module, SEA )

![p2-29](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-29.webp)

### Dataverse purpose

**Creating a general purpose Ecosysteme that enables XaaS integration:**

Anything that is presented to the Protocol *as a Service*, whatever it does, wherever it is hosted or deployed (in the cloud or on premise), whoever provides it, it can be used by the Protocol. Therein lies the integration power of the protocol, which brings infinite scalability and extensibility to the entire OKP4 ecosystem.

**Ensuring Resource Discoverability and Availability:**

Whether it involves datasets or services, it's crucial that the protocol has a means of communicating with the resources in the dataverse, ensuring that these resources are locatable and responsive to the blockchain.

The interaction between the protocol and the dataverse must be ensured by technical solutions that guarantee the continuity of service. These solutions can encompass a wide range of tools and systems, such as metadata management, connectors, APIs, and storage location details.

Metadata is integral to making the resources discoverable as it provides essential information about each resource for a better description and a registration to the ontology. In conjunction with this, connectors and APIs serve as bridges for communication between the protocol and the resources, facilitating data exchange and interactions.

**Ensuring Personal Sovereignty:**

What matters in the Dataverse design is the ability of any provider to be sovereign about what they shared in the Dataverse.

For example, because Zone governance is highly customizable, it can be defined as quite centralized (operated by a single company for example). But the Dataverse is open, trustless, and censorship-resistant, so anyone can remove access rights from what he shared in Zones and even dereference from the Dataverse completely without asking anyone for permission to do so.

### Resources of the Dataverse

OKP4 is a general-purpose Ecosystem that enables XaaS (Anything as a Service) integration. The Dataverse provides the flexibility to incorporate and utilize any digital resources. This flexibility is designed to accommodate a wide range of use cases, and to ensure that the platform remains agnostic to specific technologies or providers. There are two main categories of resources in the dataverse: data & services.

![p2-30](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-30.webp)

**Datasets:**
In the Dataverse, any datasets can be incorporated and utilized. This feature is supported by the off-chain storage of all datasets and services, enabling the handling of data of any volume, variety, and velocity. If your data is stored locally, you must ensure its network accessibility. This can be accomplished through uploading it to a locally maintained server, storing it with a cloud service provider, or integrating it into a decentralized storage network.

**Zone Governance Template:**
As the Dataverse will contain more and more Zones, governance templates will be more and more available to create a Zone quickly. A user will able to use a template and create his own library of templates. These generic templates are fully customizable according to users needs.

Theses templates can refer to several aspects of the governance:

- Business Model Template
- Autocratic or Democratic Governance Template
- Privacy-oriented Zone Template

![p2-31](/img/content/whitepaper/p2-31.webp)

**STaaS: Storage as a service:**

The Dataverse is capable of supporting all storage options. These range from local storage options to cloud storage solutions operated by major providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Additionally, decentralized storage networks like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Filecoin, or Arweave can also be integrated into the platform.

**Compute-as-a-Service:**

Similarly, the Dataverse is adaptable to a range of computation options. While many services will be provided as APIs with their own computational resources, others can be executed on cloud services operated by commercial entities or decentralized compute resources. This flexibility is essential for accommodating different types of computational tasks and workloads.

**Identity Provider:**

In terms of identity management, the Dataverse can integrate with various identity management services or identity standards, depending on the specific requirements. Whether it's a simple, decentralized identity management system or a more complex, centralized identity service, the platform can support it, providing secure and flexible solutions for identity management.

**Orchestration-as-a-Service:**

The Orchestration Service is **a crucial service** of the Protocol which orchestrates the invocations of other services. It is a reflex component of the Ecosystem that listens to the transactions of the blockchain and is triggered on command, when a particular transaction of execution request is registered in the blockchain.It's important to note that, given the potential for multiple instances of the service and several types of orchestration services, there is a decentralized mechanism in place with Pactum that ensures the correct instance of the appropriate type is executed.

**Algorithms and Models:**

Algorithms and models of all kinds can be deployed and utilized in the Dataverse. These can take the form of raw code that lacks computational infrastructure, or be provided as an Application Programming Interface (API). The choice depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

**Analytic-as-a-Service:**

In an era of increasing data complexity and volume, effective knowledge representation is pivotal. The Analytics and Business Intelligence services is designed to transform raw data into useful insights, employing tools of B.I and Knowledge Graphs.

BI tools can be effectively employed to comprehend the data shared within the zones and facilitate the extraction of useful knowledge. Knowledge Graph can facilitate the interpretation of the complex interactions and dependencies within the dataverse, offering an intuitive view of the knowledge extraction processes.
