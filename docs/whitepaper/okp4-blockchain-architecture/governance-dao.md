# Governance / DAO

The DAO and governance space has seen rapid and drastic changes in recent years. OKP4 will need to be flexible to learn and keep up with the trend. OKP4 DAO is operated by a distributed organization that requieres a well-defined governance mechanism in order to coordinate various changes to the blockchain such as software upgrades and constitutional amendments. The protocol's operating rules allow for cohesion between stakeholders on all types of issues such as theft, bugs, management, etc., allowing for faster and cleaner resolution or management.

Validators and any staked KNOW holders are eligible to vote on all governance proposals that may change predefined system parameters, vote on changes to the rules that govern DAO policies, coordinate upgrades, propose improvements, extensions or changes for the protocol. In addition, ALL validators are responsible for voting on ALL proposals.

If the validator does not vote on a proposal within the time limit, he/she will be automatically disabled for a period of time (1 week by default). Delegators automatically inherit the vote of the delegated validator. This vote can be changed manually.

Each Data Space can also have its own rules (Rulebook) and its own governance mechanism that allows users to have freedom and potential to experiment without permissions. For more information please click here.

The DAO will have its own treasury in order to encourage development and improvements of the protocol (grants), to encourage liquidity providing, to deposit more liquidity on an exchanges if needed, provide insurance to users...

In order to discuss and work on the proposals, a forum will be made available on the block explorer. Once they are well constructed and the required amount has been deposited, they will be submitted to a vote.

The rules are written in the Governance section of the Token model, click here.

***Proposal Pool***

In order to offer the possibility to anyone to make a voting proposal, we introduce the concept of proposal pool. If someone has a proposal to make but does not have enough tokens to launch the proposal alone, it is possible to launch a proposal pool. Over a given period of time (before the voting period), anyone who thinks the proposal is a good idea and deserves to be voted on can come and deposit KNOW in this pool. If the amount of KNOW tokens is reached before the end of the period, the proposal passes as a classic proposal and is governed by classic rules; if the period is exceeded and the total amount is not met, the contributors are refunded.

***Voting Parameters***

- Minimum deposit: 600 KNOW. Subject to change depending on the price of the token and the choices of the DAO
- Maximum deposit period: 14 days. After this period, if the minimum deposit is not reached, the proposal is rejected
- Voting period: 5 days
- Quorum: 30%. Minimum participation depending on the number of tokens staked by the validators
- Threshold: 50%. Validating majority
- Veto threshold: 33%. Option in the vote to reduce the threshold
