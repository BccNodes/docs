# Overview

The functionalities of the OKP4 blockchain are divided by nature according to their responsibility and functional scope.

The following diagram shows the different specific parts of the OKP4 blockchain, which are detailed in the following sections.

## The question of implementation

A choice arises as to how services are implemented in the OKP4 blockchain. There are two choices:

- Use a _module_, a powerful extension mechanism provided by the Cosmos SDK that allows to implement features natively in the blockchain.
- Use a (stateful) _Smart Contract_, an extension mechanism offered by a Virtual Machine capable of interpreting an assembly-like language in the blockchain. For this, [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) is the option.

The following table compares the two approaches according to different criteria:

|                         | Cosmos SDK | CosmWasm |
|-------------------------|------------|----------|
| Speed of Development    | +          | - (Rust) |
| Customization           | +          | -        |
| Performance             | +          | ?        |
| Strict Resource Control | -          | +        |
| Ease of maintenance     | -          | +        |
| Modularity              | -          | +        |

For the OKP4 blockchain, we consider a Smart Contract (CosmWasm) implementation strategy by default, and for specific cases, a native implementation per module in the blockchain.
