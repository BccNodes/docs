# Exec

The smart contract `exec` is in charge of "orchestrating" the execution of the different services.

The smart contract does not interact directly with the services, but maintains in the blockchain an order book of the different executions to be carried out, as well as the history of all the executions to form a knowledge graph of all the processings.
