# Abstract

![OKP4 Logo](/img/content/OKP4.jpg)

OKP4 is a public blockchain specifically designed to build the Dataverse, which will be the foundation of Data Applications.

OKP4 is designed to become a homeland for builders, data providers, communities, data scientists & users to unlock tangible value creation thanks to data sharing.

The OKP4 Protocol enables anyone to create Data Spaces where communities can agree on rules and contribute with any dataset, algorithm, storage or computation resource to create new data applications. Anything, even identity and consent solutions, can be indexed and orchestrated by the protocol according to defined rules to minimize risks, costs, and to maximize opportunities while keeping data sovereignty.

OKP4 aims to provide the perfect environment for developers to build the next generation of data applications that will bring millions of users to web3.

Through trust-minimized data sharing, a new land of opportunities emerge for people and companies, where there is no trusted third party designed to extract value from its participants or who can unilaterally change rules.

The technology: the blockchain (Proof of Stake layer 1 in the Cosmos ecosystem), the Ecosystem, the smart contracts and the development kits enable builders and communities to seize new opportunities, way beyond Decentralized Finance!
