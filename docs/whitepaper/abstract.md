OKP4 is a revolutionary public PoS layer 1 specifically designed to enable communities to trustlessly share data, algorithms and resources to build the Dataverse

The OKP4 protocol enables stakeholders to create Data Spaces where they can input their raw data without it being directly accessible to other members. Thanks to algorithms, new knowledge can be created by merging the data and extracting KPIâ€™s for all uses.

The OKP4 protocol uses Blockchain technology to manage the sovereignty within the Data Spaces that will be sealed through Smart Contracts. And the KNOW token is the means of payment within the network.

The whole system is decentralized since there is no dominant third party who dictates the rules. The authority is created by the community, thanks to the auditable, inviolable and inclusive code of smart contracts. The decision making is collective and the individual and collective interests are aligned.
