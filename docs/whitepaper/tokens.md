# Tokens

## KNOW Utility

KNOW is the native token of the OKP4 Blockchain. As a **fee token**, it is the gateway to interact with the network to share resources, define rules, consume resources, and more. These fees will pay the validators and delegators who run and secure the network.

The consensus is based on **delegated proof-of-stake** using KNOW tokens. KNOW tokens distribution across validators ensures the proper decentralization of the network. Validators can increase their ability to choose whether a new block is accepted (voting power) by having more tokens staked or delegated.

It is also the default **medium of payment** within the ecosystem. Consumers must pay KNOW tokens, while data and service providers will be retributed in KNOW tokens.

On-chain **governance** proposals will be voted with KNOW tokens. Staked KNOW holders can vote Yes, No, or No With Veto. All proposals require a minimum KNOW deposit to be published. A minimum Quorum and "Yes" threshold needs to be reached for the proposal to be accepted. A No With Veto needs to stay below a threshold for the proposal to be accepted. The governance sets these parameters.

KNOW tokens are also used in **game theory mechanisms** to ensure that data and service providers have the right incentives. Tokens can be bonded on resources as a commitment from the provider. The provider takes the risk of being slashed if his shared off-chain resource becomes unavailable or doesn't comply with his description. Also, a curation market can be enabled to incentivize data & service discoverability, incentivizing participants to lock-up tokens on specific resources to have a share of the future earnings.

### Distribution

#### Investors

These tokens are distributed to investors in the differents rounds from pre-seed to seed who contributed to the development of OKP4.

#### Foundation (strategic reserve)

This strategic reserve will be controlled by a multisig comprised of foundation members. Initially composed of members from the core team, community, validators, builders and more. All the spending will be done according to transparent decision-making. The funds will focus on many initiatives, including:

* Development: the foundation will lead the protocol development strategy with OKP4 core team. In addition to that, opportunities will be given outside of the core team through initiatives such as grants. These will be proposed by the foundation and the proposals will be reviewed by the foundation's governance body.
* Validators support: Vested tokens will be delegated to the validators whose contribution is most impactful, such as integrations, specific developments, relayer services, open source tooling and dashboards, community engagement...
* Research: research will be investigated by the foundation, with a view to finding new areas of improvement and innovation for the Protocol and its ecosystem.
* Marketing & Incentives: Through events (hackathons, conferences, on-chain competitions...), communication, these activities will focus on building a network of Builders, Data Providers, Services Providers and Users.
* Listing, Market-making, Additional liquidity provision

#### Team & Advisors

In order to build a world-class team, these tokens will reward the core team and project advisors. These tokens will be split between founders, equity investors, advisors, current and future team members. It is also a way to increase the retention of the employees over the distribution period so that the roadmap goes on as planned.

#### Airdrops

:eyes:

#### DAO Treasury

* **Grants**: our open-source Protocol advocates rapid technological progress thanks to the many paid contributors. On the one hand, the DAO will propose on-chain tasks to be done for a certain remuneration in $KNOW tokens. On the other hand, if you have an idea to improve the Protocol, you can propose your idea to the DAO. They will be voted according to their relevance to the success of the network, the technical design and the overall quality of the team. By the community, for the community.
* **LP incentives**: Liquidity Deposit Incentive Program offering a number of tokens in monthly rewards for liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn rewards based on their percentage share of the overall liquidity pool.
* **Liquidity DEXs**: in a situation where we need more liquidity than initially planned (especially if many Data Spaces decide to create their token), a part of this wallet is reserved for additional liquidity.
