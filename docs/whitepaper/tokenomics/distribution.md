Team: These tokens will reward the team for their long-term investment in the project; it is also a way to increase the retention (incentive) of the 30 employees over the distribution period so that the roadmap goes on as planned.

Advisors: These tokens are reserved for advisors who accompany us throughout the development of our project and are governed by the same rules as for the team in order to incentivize them over the long term.

DAO Treasury: 
- Grants: Our open-source protocol advocates rapid technological progress thanks to the many paid contributors. On the one hand, the DAO will propose on-chain tasks to be done for a certain remuneration in KNOW tokens. On the other hand, if you have an idea to improve the protocol, you can propose your idea to the DAO. They will be voted according to their relevance to the success of the network, the technical design and the overall quality of the team. By the community, for the community.
- LP incentives: Liquidity Deposit Incentive Program offering a number of tokens in monthly rewards for liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn rewards based on their percentage share of the overall liquidity pool.
- Liquidity DEXs: In a situation where we need more liquidity than initially planned (especially if many Data Spaces decide to create their token), a part of this wallet is reserved for additional liquidity.

Liquidity: Owned by the DAO & OKP4 Foundation to provide liquidity on DEXs and CEXs.

Foundation:
- Research: Research will be investigated by the foundation (or by scientists working for the foundation), with a view to finding new areas of improvement and creation for the protocol and its surroundings. Most of what will be found will be proposed as grants via the foundation.
- Development: It is the same as for the DAO grants, except that the grants will be proposed by researchers working for the foundation and the proposals will be reviewed by internal teams. The grants will be a little more oriented towards the financing of projects on the ecosystem, interfaces... for development teams for the ecosystem.
- Marketing: A part will be reserved for marketing to make known the OKP4 protocol, our company and to create a worldwide community. The marketing and communication activities are mainly focused on building a network of data providers, services providers and builders, but will also be geared towards a crypto community. We will focus the campaign mainly on two axes: one towards the traditional industry, and the other on the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.
- Ecosystem incentives: Any kind of incentive to develop the ecosystem. For example, hackatons, events, conferences, crypto games, crypto competitions, rewards boost...

Airdrops:
- Airdrop 1 (50%): This airdrop will be distributed at the time of the token's release under certain conditions. Objective to create a crypto community, a community of suppliers and builders, in order to incentivize them to come to our ecosystem.
- Airdrop 2 (50%): This airdrop will take place at least one year after the first one under certain conditions, such as staked airdrop 1 during one year.
