# Introducing – OKP4

The previous mentioned reasons ([see Motivation](https://docs.okp4.network/docs/whitepaper/introduction/motivation-why-we-need-data-sharing)) led us to create the Open Knowledge Protocol (OKP4). Indeed, we believe that the only option is to propose a better alternative to knowledge creation, based on digital commons that are non-extractive and decentralized. Our objective is to allow data sharing and processing services in a secure, transparent, reliable and easy way to generate the maximum amount of new knowledge.

Our OKP4 protocol not only enables the creation of Data Spaces. It also maximizes data sharing, based on Web 3.0 value chain, where providers and consumers get optimal compensation for their contribution, in a trustworthy environment. The OKP4 protocol is a community-run technology using blockchain, smart contracts and the KNOW cryptocurrency which we will discuss in later articles.

The traditional business models based upon data exchange need to evolve. As a society we need to let go of the dominant model of selling data sets and access to data flows at fixed prices. The OKP4 protocol enables data sharing without exchange. In other words, only the data coming from different services (algorithms, tools, visualisation…) is accessible to the users, not the raw data. Added to the customized Data Space’s governance, this brings confidence and also widens the scope of possibilities to innovate with economic models.

## The features of the OKP4 Protocol

We have designed the OKP4 protocol to be open, decentralized and auditable. Our solution is based on 4 products :

- **OKP4 Blockchain**: the layer 1 for data sharing
A public blockchain protocol designed specifically to handle the complexity of trustless data sharing and value sharing

   - Decentralization and trust is guaranteed by the Tendermint Consensus & our native token $KNOW
   - An open-source network controlled by its stakeholders
   - A vibrant Smart Contract Hub powered by CosmWasm
   - IBC (Inter-Blockchain Protocol) enables seamless communication with other blockchains

- **OKP4 Ecosystem**: empower the dataverse
Anyone can plug its own infrastructure into the ecosystem and connect it through the blockchain. OKP4 ecosystem enables XaaS (anything as a service). Agnostic by design!

- **OKP4 Development Kit**: it allows anyone to create and design Data Space with as much freedom as possible. For developers, data scientists and communities at large :
    - Customize Data Space governance with no-code tools & templates
    - Build dApps from software to interfaces
    - Use or provide components & resources in the OKP4 Ecosystem

- **OKP4 Dataverse**: user-friendly tools to share, contribute, benefit and earn. (wallet / browser extension, blockchain explorer, dataverse portal, catalog of dApps, governance interfaces, etc.)
