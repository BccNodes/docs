# Motivation - Why we need data sharing

Digital innovation has tremendously impacted the way we do business, the way we exchange and consume information. Data has become a resource upon which many businesses have been built. It altered our everyday life in every possible way. The amount of generated data keeps increasing and over the next decade, data collection and analysis will be at the core of every business model.

And yet, data exploitation remains within a handful of companies and organisations. How could we make the exploitation and sharing of data accessible to the greatest number of organisations and people ?

## From Data to Knowledge

Data is an objective and elementary description of reality, an observation, facts intended to be processed and interpreted by men. From data we create information. It is the signifier attached to the data or to a set of data by association. Information is usually subjective, defined by context. And when we combine information, rules, reasoning, and experience, we create knowledge. And knowledge is THE limiting factor to common good. Thus, in order to develop knowledge, we need data.

Data is a non-rival immaterial asset; it can be easily used and duplicated an infinite number of times without changing the nature or the quality. The production of knowledge from data is therefore theoretically infinite. However today, trusted third parties coordinate and govern the data flux in the world.

## Knowledge is essential to common good

At OKP4, we strongly believe that knowledge is essential to common good and that it should be accessible to everyone with minimum constraint. Data should be shared to multiply aggregations and contextualization’s and create value-added and usable knowledge for organizations and people.

Though they have enhanced our live in many ways, traditional trusted third parties have also created a dependency that limits us. The Web 2.0 value chain is based on providers and consumers that enrich platform aggregators with their data, without really getting much in return. The interests of all parties are not aligned and so it becomes an obstacle to data sharing.

Companies want to use Big Data, they produce data, but they don’t know how to exploit it properly. They lack technical skills, they don’t trust the aggregators and the data they contribute with is not rewarded at its fair value.

All these issues are all, eventually, governance issues. You must agree on the rules, on how they are enforced and on how rules are changed. The key is to reach consensus and build the best tools to enforce it.

Then, comes the lack of incentives to share data that never outweigh the risks and costs associated with data sharing. This results in exclusive private data lakes operated by third parties that are unwilling to share data.

Which means underutilization of data, market failures, repression of innovation and an immeasurable opportunity-cost for them and for society at large.

**But what if we could enable trustless data sharing and unlock this untapped potential?**
