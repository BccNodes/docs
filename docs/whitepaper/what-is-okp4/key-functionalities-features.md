# Key functionalities & features

**Generic**: OKP4 is a general-purpose communication infrastructure that enables XaaS - Anything as a Service. The protocol enable anyone to share any data, any algorithm, any storage, any cloud, any SSI, etc. Anyone can earn from these assets and services and make them valuable for the community.

**Customizable**: Besides WHAT you can share, OKP4 is highly customizible in terms of HOW you can share. Smart contracts that govern Data Space can be copied, edited, reinvented in infinite ways. Customization is applied to the rules (business models, access mechanisms, constraints on service providers...) and also the mechanisms to change the rules (who can vote, weight of their vote, fixed or dynamic through a token, etc).

**Scalable**: its generic infrastructure makes it scalable by design, as workflow orchestration, computation and storage is done off-chain and is theoretically unlimited. Nevertheless, indexation, rule enforcement, governance and value-sharing is done on-chain. With a capacity of 10 000TPS, limits may be reached when dozens to hundreds of highly used data apps coexist on the OKP4 ecosystem. That is one of the reasons a roll-up strategy is implemented to enable layer-2 scalability and even more roll-up-specific functionalities (such as on-chain privacy features).

**Decentralized**: The OKP4 network has no trusted parties or single points of failure for any function. Many centralized components can intervene in data workflows but are not mandatory. As said before, the infrastructure is generic and its thriving ecosystem will be composed of many centralized & decentralized independent components.
OKP4 blockchain is decentralized thanks to the Tendermint consensus and many validator nodes that find consensus on the state of the network. Its governance is also decentralized through a DAO. Eventually, as with every PoS networks and token-based DAOs, its decentralization is dependant on the distribution of the token and the ability of one stakeholder to acquire a "dangerous" stake in the network. Eventally, it all comes down to the value and liquidity of its token on the market. The more distributed and expensive to acquire the token is, the more it can be and stay decentralized.

**Permissionless**: Anyone can become a validator, delegator, governance participant, data, algorithm, storage and computation provider, builder, curator or user. Some Data Spaces may be restricted on the user & provider sides, but the infrastructure will always be open and permissionless, ensuring censorship-resistance at the foundation of the technology stack.

**Secure**: OKP4 is designed for security at the blockchain level (due to its decentralized nature and robust consensus mechanism), but also at the data level. The blockchain enforces rules such as access control that are immutable (except if consensus is reached to change these rules of course). That way, vulnerability will never be on the blockchain side, but on the user/provider side (if there's a breach in his own cloud infrastructure for a self-hosted data provider, or if a user gets his private keys stolen for exemple).

**Complex workflows**: A user/builder can design complex workflows such as thousands of datasets interact with hundreds of services to produce a single product or application. A set of tools is provided to enable anyone to easily build such workflows and innovate on how data can be used and shared trustlessly.

**Synergetic**: OKP4 is modular in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of governance. While the blockchain is as decentralized as possible, the Data Spaces and resources that interact through it may have centralized components and governance. This enables web2 and web3 synergies with quick-coordination, human-centric UI while keeping web3 strengths such as data sovereignty, tokenized governance, powerful incentives, trustlessness, auditability... OKP4 is then an open infrastructure that suits needs on a spectrum from decentralized communities to private businesses, with many hybrid models and synergies to build and discover.

**Incentivized**: to ensure that high-value applications can rely on the network to keep all of its functionalities listed above, OKP4 inventivizes validators, delegators, providers, curators, builders to ensure development, maintenance, involvement into the ecosystem. Incentives are designed to align individual interest with public interest through low inflation, fair value distribution and punishment of detrimental behaviors.
