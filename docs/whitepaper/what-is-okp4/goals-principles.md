# Goals & principles

Data intermediaries will be key players in the trillion dollar data sharing economy of tomorrow.
Decentralized data intermediaries will dominate centralized alternatives.

OKP4's goal is to be the leading decentralized data intermediary by enabling a new wave of innovation & use cases through unique coordination features.

To do that, we followed 7 principles to maximize opportunities and minimize risks & costs:

Opportunity-maximization: onboard builders, contributors and users to create new use cases and share value.

- **Design for builders**: to maximize adoption through valuable data applications. Builders will innovate and design Data Spaces & communities that will enable this wave of valuable data applications. OKP4 is then designed to facilitate on-boarding of builders though SDKs and docs, fast deployment through tools & templates, and community empowerment to create a thriving ecosystem.
- **Design for contributors**: to maximize value created by data application by onboarding contributors. Value-sharing models and easy to use tools will incentivize participants in infinite ways, encouraging them to share data, algorithms, storage and computation towards a common goal.
- **Design for freedom**: to maximize opportunities by aligning interest between providers, builders and users through freedom of innovation and customization.
- **Design for interoperability**: to maximize synergies at the blockchain level through cross-chain communication, at the infrastructure level thanks to agnosticity, and also at the Data Space level through interoperability of standards and applications leveraging multiple Data Spaces.

Risk-minimization: let anyone build and contribute by minimizing trust and technical issues.

- **Design for sovereignty**: raw data is never stored on-chain. Some metadata is but only for features such as discoverability, value sharing & security. In some applications, data can be shared through privacy-preserving algorithms to provide a valuable output without transfering the data to another particupant/user. That way, data providers can be rewarded without any risk of losing sovereignty over their data.
- **Design for trustlessness**: every rule, rights and governance mechanism can be enforced on-chain by the decentralized network of validators. Coordination between providers (data, algorithms, storage, computation), builders, users, curators and governance participants is autonomous, fluid and unstoppable.

Cost-minimization:

- **Design for minimal extraction**: no intermediary, only an open digital infrastructure that doesn't seek value-extraction. Its scalable and dedicated nature makes it unlikely to be congested and/or expensive. This app-specific network is supported by incentivized nodes enabling low fees for anyone.
