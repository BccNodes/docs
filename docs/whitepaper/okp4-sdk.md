## OKP4 Design System

The [OKP4 Design System](https://github.com/okp4/ui) is an open-source set of components and resources created to facilitate the design and development of web interfaces in the OKP4 Ecosystem for everyone. This design system serves as a reference for teams working around the OKP4 Ecosystem, enabling them to design and develop web interfaces with speed, consistency and quality.

The OKP4 Design System follows the [Atomic Design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner.

- **Atoms**: are the smallest possible components. The OKP4 Design System offers the basic building blocks for building interfaces such as: [typography](https://github.com/okp4/ui/issues/98), [themes](https://github.com/okp4/ui/issues/96), language, [buttons](https://github.com/okp4/ui/issues/119), [toaster](https://github.com/okp4/ui/issues/179), [cards](https://github.com/okp4/ui/issues/120), etc.
- **Molecules**: are the composition of one or more components of atoms.
- **Organisms**: are the combination of molecules that work together or, if necessary, with atoms, to form more elaborate interfaces. The OKP4 Design System offers advanced organisms for the OKP4 Ecosystem like a Token Faucet, a Web Wallet, a Dataverse Explorer...

## Data Space governance templates

As the Dataverse will contain more and more Data Spaces, governance templates will be more and more available to create a Data Space quickly.

A user will able to use a template and create his own library of templates.
