# Catalogs

The catalog lists the datasets and services declared in the protocol.

As a reminder, a dataset or a service can participate in several Data Spaces by being stored at the source.

A user can see the datasets and services of the Data Spaces in which he participates but also those of the open Data Spaces. The user can apply different filters such as type (dataset or service), date of declaration, tags, spatial or temporal coverage.

The catalog includes a search engine and a recommendation system.

The catalog is available in several visualizations:

- Cards
- List
- Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph represents the link between the entities (datasets and services) to create knowledge. It allows to visualize the contribution of datasets and services in the generation of new knowledge.

According to the attached consents an element and its metadata will be visible or not.
