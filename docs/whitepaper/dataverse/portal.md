# Portal

The OKP4 portal allows to interact with dataverse. It aggregates the dataverse services such as wallets, catalog, files deposit, dapps, block explorer and more.

Although parts of the portal is open (especially for content and support), each user can log in to get access to all the services.

Through the OKP4 portal, a user is informed in real time of the activities related to the Data Space of which he is a member and the datasets or services he provides. Thus, users follow their contribution to the Knowledge creation and the associated retributions.  

The portal is customized according to the membership of the different Data Spaces and the roles of the user in them.
