# Wallets/ID

To manage identities and associated assets circulating in the OKP4 ecosystem (KNOW and other coins that will emerge in the future), a non-custodial wallet application is necessary.

It means that the user controls his keys.

This enables anyone to:

- Create a private key and wallet
- Import/export identities from/to other SSI systems (self-sovereign identity)
- Control assets on the OKP4 ecosystem (send, stake, swap)
- Send assets out of the OKP4 ecosystem
- Create and manage multisig wallets
- Control datasets and services indexed in the ecosystem
- Control participation in Data Spaces
- Vote on DAO governance
- Vote on Data Space governance if eligible
- Curate data and services
- Create and interact with smart contracts

Cosmos-native wallets such as Keplr will be able to perform most of these functions.
But functional doesn't mean optimal.
In terms of UX, many OKP4-specific actions and features will be necessary.

What if you could automatically import web2 platform data into your sovereign wallet while you interact with apps and pages in your browser? What if you could watch your data usage and token analytics in real time in your wallet? What if you could navigate across the graphs of your contributions? And many other data-specific features that generic-purpose wallets can't cover.

The OKP4 wallet will take the form of a web page and a dedicated browser extension. It will be extended to a smartphone application.
