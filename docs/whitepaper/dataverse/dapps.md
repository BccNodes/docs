# Data Applications

Data applications are a suite of software that leverages outputs from a (or many) Data Space.

It can take many forms. For exemple it could be a BI software that enables data visualization, a push API, a script that performs actions automatically (e.g. a bot), etc.

The data application will be the medium through which tokens flow into the OKP4 ecosystem. Some data applications will enable end-users to interact with the blockchain through their wallets (thus paying on a per-transaction basis) while some others will have custom off-chain business model (such as a subscription model of exemple) and pay the ecosystem for the knowledge it creates.

Data Applications have dedicated identities and may have dedicated application treasury to pay for services on behalf of end-users, if enabled. This enables some web3-enabled applications to have seamless, web2-like UX.
