# Files Deposit

OKP4 Files Deposit allows data providers to declare a dataset into the OKP4 Protocol.  

The data provider can fill in the contextual metadata of the dataset. This information will allow other users to understand how the dataset is constructed. The completion of the metadata will improve the ranking of a dataset in the search engine of the catalog.

A data provider is not necessarily the owner of the dataset if it has permission to declare it in the protocole.

Each file deposit is a transaction that must be signed by a wallet. The data provider pays a transaction fee.
