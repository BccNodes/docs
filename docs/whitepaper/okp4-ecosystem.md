# OKP4 Ecosystem

## Overview

OKP4 is a general-purpose ecosystem that enables [XaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service) - Anything as a Service. Therein lies the extensibility and versatility of the protocol. Anything that is presented to the protocol *as a Service* can then be used by the protocol. In a data space, Services are not hosted centrally but anywhere (in the cloud or in premise), from any provider and are only shared when necessary according to strict rules.

There is a large possible typology of services and the protocol currently recognizes the following types:

- *Data* as a Service - Services allowing data management: storage, accessibility, administration, etc.
- *Algorithm* as a Service - Services that process data to produce meaningful information (i.e. knowledge), for instance: machine learning algorithms.
- *Infrastructure* as a Service - Services that offers compute, storage and networking resources.

The ecosystem is based on a fully decentralized open and agnostic architecture, which is:

- *scalable*, designed to scale to infinity,
- *interoperable* to ensure integration with existing and future services,
- *auditable*, by the fine description of the topology of the ecosystem, by the recording in an ontology of all the activities.
