# OKP4 Blockchain

## Overview

The blockchain is the single source of truth that is used to coordinate participants of the Dataverse.

## Consensus : Tendermint

In this section we briefly describe the Tendermint consensus protocol.

### Validators

In classical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) algorithms, each node has the same weight. In Tendermint, nodes have an amount of voting power, and are called validators. Validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting cryptographic signatures, or votes, to agree upon the next block. According to our model, the voting power of each validator is determined by the amount of staking tokens bonded as collateral.

### Consensus

Tendermint is a partially synchronous BFT consensus protocol derived from the DLS consensus algorithm. It is notable for its simplicity, performance, and fork-accountability (the processes that caused the consensus to fail can be identified and punished according to the rules). The protocol requires a fixed know set of validators, where each validator is identified by their public key. Validators attempt to come to consensus on one block at a time, where a block is a list of transactions. Voting for consensus on a block proceeds in rounds. Each round has a round-leader, or proposer, who proposes a block. The validators then vote, in stages, on whether to accept the proposed block or move on to the next round. The proposer for a round is chosen deterministically from the ordered list of validators, in proportion to their voting power.
Tendermint's security derives from its use of optimal Byzantine fault-tolerance via super-majority (>2/3) voting power and a locking mechanism.
Together, they ensure that:

- ≥1/3 voting power must be Byzantine to cause a violation of safety, where more than two values are committed
- If any set of validators ever succeeds in violating safety, or even attemps to do so, they can be identified by the protocol. This includes both voting for conflicting blocks and broadcasting unjustified votes

Despite its strong guarantees, Tendermint provides exceptional performance by providing thousands transactions per second, with commit latencies on the order of 1 to 2 seconds. Notably, performance of well over a thousand transactions per second is maintained even in harsh adversarial conditions, with validators crashing or broadcasting maliciously crafted votes.

### Light Clients

The need to sync all block headers us eliminated in Tendermint PoS as the existence of an alternative chain (a fork) means ≥1/3 of bonded stake can be slashed. Of course, since slashing requires that someone share evidence of a fork, light clients should store any block-hash commits that it sees. Tendermint light clients need only to keep up with changes to the validator set, and then verify the >2/3 PreCommits in the latest block to determine the latest state and avoid long range attacks. Succinct light client proofs also enable IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication).

### Preventing Attacks

Tendermint has protective measures for preventing certain notable attacks, like long-range-nothing-at-stake double spends and censorship.

### ABCI (Application BlockChain Interface)

Tendermint consensus algorithm is implemented in a program called Tendermint Core. Tendermint BFT connects to blockchain applications via the ABCI. ABCI in an interface that defines the boundary between the replication engine (the blockchain), and the state machine (the application). By using a socket protocol, we enable a consensus engine running in one process to manage an application state running in another.

## Canonical Services

A large number of blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem share a common set of services, either because they are provided by layer 0 of the Cosmos SDK or because they are standard in the ecosystem.

This section lists the main services that are available in the OKP4 blockchain.

### From the Cosmos SDK

The OKP4 blockchain is based on the [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network) layer 0 and, as such, comes with a set of functionalities any blockchain application needs. These functionalities are grouped into _modules_, each module being responsible for a well-defined functional scope.

The list of integrated modules available in the OKP4 blockchain can be found in the [Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/). The main ones are briefly described hereafter.

#### Bank

The `bank` module is responsible for handling multi-asset coin transfers between accounts and tracking special-case pseudo-transfers which must work differently with particular kinds of accounts.

#### Staking

The `staking` module enables the OKP4 blockchain to support an advanced Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system where holders of KNOWs can become validators and delegate tokens to validators.

#### Governance

The `governance` module enables the OKP4 blockchain to establish a governance on-chain. In this system, holders of KNOWs can vote on proposals on a 1 token 1 vote basis.

### From the Cosmos Ecosystem

### Wasm

`wasm` is a module plugable into the [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network), provided by the [CosmWasm](https://docs.cosmwasm.com) project, that enables the OKP4 blockchain to provide a smart contracting platform through which the functionalities of the OKP4 blockchain is implemented, operated.

### CosmWasm Plus

The [CosmWasm Plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) repository is a collection of specification and contracts within [CosmWasm](https://docs.cosmwasm.com) virtual machine.

In the context of the OKP4 blockchain, the following smart contracts (and/or specifications) are considered (non exhaustive and subject to evolve):

- `cw20-base`: A smart contract (compliant with [cw20](https://crates.io/crates/cw20) specification) implementing a standard API for tokens, with the following functionalities: transfer tokens from one account to another, get the current token balance of an account, get the total supply of the token available on the network...

- `cw20-atomic-swap`: A smart contract (compliant with [cw20](https://crates.io/crates/cw20) specification) implementing atomic swaps for both native and `cw20` tokens.

- `cw20-staking`:  A smart contract (compliant with [cw20](https://crates.io/crates/cw20) specification) provides staking derivatives.

- `cw3-multisig`: A smart contract (compliant with [cw3](https://crates.io/crates/cw3) specification) for multiSig/voting.

- `cw4-group`: A smart contract (compliant with [cw4](https://crates.io/crates/cw4) specification) for storing group membership, which can be combined with `cw3` multisigs.

- `cw721-base`: A smart contract (compliant with [cw721](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) specification) for managing Non-fungible tokens (NFT).

### Oracles

Similar to the [Terra blockchain](https://www.terra.money/) and its [Oracle module](https://docs.wcdc.me/docs/dev-spec-oracle), the Oracle module provides the OKP4 blockchain with an up-to-date and accurate price feed of exchange rates of $KNOW against other currencies.

Some other Oracles networks may be used in the future for enhanced functionalities (e.g. Chainlink, Band...)

## OKP4 Services

### Overview

The functionalities of the OKP4 blockchain are divided by nature according to their responsibility and functional scope.

The following diagram shows the different specific parts of the OKP4 blockchain, which are detailed in the following sections.

<Drawio content={blockchainServicesSvg} />

#### The question of implementation

A choice arises as to how services are implemented in the OKP4 blockchain. There are two choices:

- Use a _module_, a powerful extension mechanism provided by the Cosmos SDK that allows to implement features natively in the blockchain.
- Use a (stateful) _Smart Contract_, an extension mechanism offered by a Virtual Machine capable of interpreting an assembly-like language in the blockchain. For this, [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) is the option.

The following table compares the two approaches according to different criteria:

|                         | Cosmos SDK | CosmWasm |
|-------------------------|------------|----------|
| Speed of Development    | +          | - ([Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) |
| Customization           | +          | -        |
| Performance             | +          | ?        |
| Strict Resource Control | -          | +        |
| Ease of maintenance     | -          | +        |
| Modularity              | -          | +        |

For the OKP4 blockchain, we consider a Smart Contract (CosmWasm) implementation strategy by default, and for specific cases, a native implementation per module in the blockchain.

### Dataspace

The smart contract `data space` is in charge of managing the Data Spaces. The smart contract manages the entire life cycle of a Data Space, from its creation to its destruction.

### Rule

The smart contract `rule` ensures strict compliance with the governance rules established for each Data Space and extensively for the entire dataverse.

### Exec

The smart contract `exec` is in charge of "orchestrating" the execution of the different services.

The smart contract does not interact directly with the services, but maintains in the blockchain an order book of the different executions to be carried out, as well as the history of all the executions to form a knowledge graph of all the processings.

### Pay

The smart contract `pay` is responsible for maintaining a policy of paying for data and services defined by the governance rules.

### Logic

The module `logic` introduces into the blockchain an "engine" that is powerful enough to interpret and guarantee the correct execution of the dataspaces' governance rules.

## Governance / DAO

The DAO and governance space has seen rapid and drastic changes in recent years. OKP4 will need to be flexible to learn and keep up with the trend. OKP4 DAO is operated by a distributed organization that requieres a well-defined governance mechanism in order to coordinate various changes to the blockchain such as software upgrades and constitutional amendments. The protocol's operating rules allow for cohesion between stakeholders on all types of issues such as theft, bugs, management, etc., allowing for faster and cleaner resolution or management.

Validators and any staked KNOW holders are eligible to vote on all governance proposals that may change predefined system parameters, vote on changes to the rules that govern DAO policies, coordinate upgrades, propose improvements, extensions or changes for the protocol. In addition, ALL validators are responsible for voting on ALL proposals.

If the validator does not vote on a proposal within the time limit, he/she will be automatically disabled for a period of time (1 week by default). Delegators automatically inherit the vote of the delegated validator. This vote can be changed manually.

Each Data Space can also have its own rules (Rulebook) and its own governance mechanism that allows users to have freedom and potential to experiment without permissions. For more information please click here.

The DAO will have its own treasury in order to encourage development and improvements of the protocol (grants), to encourage liquidity providing, to deposit more liquidity on an exchanges if needed, provide insurance to users...

In order to discuss and work on the proposals, a forum will be made available on the block explorer. Once they are well constructed and the required amount has been deposited, they will be submitted to a vote.

The rules are written in the Governance section of the Token model, click [here](/docs/whitepaper/token-model#governance).

<br/>

### Proposal Pool

In order to offer the possibility to anyone to make a voting proposal, we introduce the concept of proposal pool. If someone has a proposal to make but does not have enough tokens to launch the proposal alone, it is possible to launch a proposal pool. Over a given period of time (before the voting period), anyone who thinks the proposal is a good idea and deserves to be voted on can come and deposit KNOW in this pool. If the amount of KNOW tokens is reached before the end of the period, the proposal passes as a classic proposal and is governed by classic rules; if the period is exceeded and the total amount is not met, the contributors are refunded.

<br/>

### Voting Parameters

- Minimum deposit: 600 KNOW. Subject to change depending on the price of the token and the choices of the DAO.
- Maximum deposit period: 14 days. After this period, if the minimum deposit is not reached, the proposal is rejected.
- Voting period: 5 days.

## OKP4 Ontology

### A formal model of the information

[Ontology](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology) is the most general and fundamental concept of the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). Ontologies are linked to various data elements representing conceptualized information about these data items. This allows for unambiguous identification, understanding, navigation and usage of this information.

OKP4 uses an ontology to describe and define the different forms of vocabularies used in the protocol in a standard format. The aim is to model a semantic network of all the _entities_ (data spaces, data, services, processing workflows) by semantically characterizing what they are and the relationships they maintain between them.   

The following 

<div class="text--center graph-svg-container">
  <OntologySvg />
</div>

The ontology also provides a complete living understanding and knowledge of the datasets within a data space, their transformation (by the services), as well as the governance rules that apply (data sharing, consents, policy rules). From that perspective, it provides the Data Lineage (allowing the traceability) of each piece of data in the data spaces during the different processings, resulting in a Knowledge Graph of any data in the dataverse.

### Ontology is at the heart of the blockchain

Ontology has a special place in the OKP4 protocol as much of the information is encoded and stored as an ontology _on-chain_ in the blockchain transactions. Therefore, the blockchain is the only source of truth and any dApp can consult the semantic information that has been added, modified or deleted in the system.

For example, the creation of a new data space requires a metadata profile that describes and characterises the data space created. This creation is performed by a blockchain transaction containing the encoded RDF description conforming to the formal model:
