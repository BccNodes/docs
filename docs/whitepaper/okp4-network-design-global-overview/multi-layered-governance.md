# Multi-layered governance

The main critics we can address at web2 companies and especially tech giants is their extractive nature, their willingness to keep users captive on their platforms, and their increasing power controlled by a centralized governance.

But web3 also has its own sets of problems, its pretty wild and self-reliant, UX is bad, allocation of capital can be messy and coordination is often suboptimal.

To build the best data sharing infrastructure, we need to combine web2 and web3 strengths through multi-layered modular governance:
- OKP4 blockchain is decentralized by design, with its set of token holders that propose and vote on governance proposals.
- Data Spaces have custom governance. Data space governance can be centralized (one or few accounts are designated to have the ability to design rules) or decentralized (through token-based voting power).
- Data applications also have custom governance. Many of them will be centralized as it can be as simple as a front-end to consume data products, but more complex community-run applications can be considered.
- Datasets and services are sovereign to their owners. Providers (individuals or companies) can define general permissions/requirements for their data and services, but also can hand-pick the data spaces (and align with the data space's rules) in which they want to contribute.

This mixture of governance layers enable the Dataverse to combine strengths from web2 and web3 worlds: where centralized governance models can be build on top of an open decentralized infrastructure, enabling interoperability and sovereignty by design for the data providers and users.
