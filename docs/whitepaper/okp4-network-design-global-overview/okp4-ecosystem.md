# OKP4 Ecosystem

OKP4 is a public blockchain protocol deploying a suite of data applications where communities are incentivized to share data and services confidently. OKP4 is a layer 1 customized for the knowledge economy where anyone, any group, any company, can join or create an ecosystem of contributors with custom rules, governance mechanisms and business models to build useful data applications.

[ IMAGE Protocol ]

On the macro level, there is 4 key concepts to understand:

- OKP4 blockchain (protocol layer)
- data spaces (contribution & governance layer)
- data applications (user layer)
- datasets & services

**OKP4 blockchain** is the decentralized layer that:

- indexes (any) data and services
- exposes metadata of indexed data and services
- initiates data workflows
- enforce governance rules, including access rights and value transfers
It is the single source of truth that is used to build autonomous and decentralized data applications.

**Data spaces** are sets of rules and governance mechanisms set in smart contracts, designed to optimize data and services sharing within a community. It is not a common database but an abstraction that defines the interaction between datasets and services, from access rights and business models. Providers share data and services within a data space, with conditions specific to that data space. They can share their data in multiple data spaces. Data Space have their own customizable governance mechanisms. The OKP4 blockchain can host an endless number of data spaces.

**Data applications** are built on top of data spaces and their inherent rules. They use the data-products (outputs from OKP4) as inputs in data applications that provides information, knowledge, initializes actions, etc. Data applications can have their own governance mechanisms. For exemple, private companies may use outputs from a decentralized Data Space to build their own applications.

**Datasets** are bytes of information stored on a device (IPFS, or custom private cloud), indexed on the protocol and accessible through a dedicated gateway. **Services** are software associated with computation/storage resources accessible through an API that ensure an unlimited number of data-treatment operations such as data processing services, automatic description of data, knowledge graph query services, etc.
Datasets and services provide the elementary building blocks and tools that will interact within data applications according to the orders specified in the blockchain protocol. In other words, each dataset and service is linked to one or more data applications (rules), and interacts with other data sources when called by the protocol.
