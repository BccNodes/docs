# Data Spaces

To recap, OKP4 enables the Dataverse, an ever-expanding universe coordinated by the blockchain.

But how are the resources coordinated? According to which rules?

This is where Data Space matters!

## Purpose of Data Spaces

Rights and rules such as secure access rights and fair business model are the key to bring trust and align interests between participants.

OKP4 enables anyone to build and join an infinite number of highly customizable Data Spaces.

Data Spaces refer to an agreement between data and services providers according to a clearly defined set of rules. Each data & service provider can adhere or not on letting some of his resources participate in a Data Space.

A Data Space is an abstraction that comprises:

- Bundle of rights & rules that regulates interactions between data, algorithms, infrastructure and every resources shared by participants
- Governance mechanisms to adapt these rules

A Data Space is highly customizable regarding every aspect of data sharing: access control, data & service management, business models, governance frameworks...

Governance mechanisms can also be customized to satisfy businesses and small teams (monosigs & multisigs) or decentralized communities (through a custom Data Space token).

In a Data Space, datasets and algorithms are not stored centrally but at source and are therefore only shared (via semantic interoperability) when necessary. Several Data Spaces can have data and algorithms in common and can be nested and overlapping. There is then an endless combination of oftentimes interoperable Data Spaces where participants, assets and resources can interact freely and create value.

These Data Spaces are the source of new value chains in the knowledge economy by enabling trust-minimized data sharing, offering possibilites way beyond what exists today with transactional data marketplaces.

## Data Space technical description

The OKP4 Protocol allows to build highly customized Data Spaces and to manage them.

Thanks to the OKP4 Development Kit, anyone can create and design Data Space with as much freedom as possible. This development kit comprises Rulebook templates and no-code tools to set the governance rules.

:::tip  
OKP4 Development Kit is designed to give as much freedom as possible for developers, data scientists and communities at large. Freedom of development, freedom of business models, freedoms of standards... freedom of innovation.

:::

The Rulebook describes a set of rules, standards and tools shared with Data Space participants, based on 5 pillars: ethics, legal, data management, technical requirements & business models.

Once the Data Space is created through the Development Kit, the governance rules of this Data Space it is encoded into a [Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) allowing the rules to be expressed as a formal code which is:

- stored on-chain and is freely auditable by anyone,
- interpretable by a smart contract in a fully decentralized and autonomous way. Thus, for any transaction sent to the OKP4 blockchain, this smart contract ensures that the transaction complies with the rights established by the Data Space governance rules. If not, the transaction is rejected.

## Data Space Rules

A Data Space is governed by a bundle of rights and rules that define the permitted interactions between data, algorithms, resources and users.

The rules can refer to data management, retribution, business model or technical requirements for instance. All the rules are totally customizable and in particular can be amended provided that specific provisions have been made. By amendments, we mean an addition or modification to the governance rules, provided that they are compatible with the rules already defined (consistency).

### Examples of rules

**Data management**

- All metadata of datasets and services must be described
- Restrictions on the license of the dataset
- Only one type of actors has access to the raw data

**Technical requirements**

- Each data provider stores its own data

**Business models**

- Retribution of contributors according to the template XXX: Open data are not retributed and other datasets are retributed in function of the service consumption
- Retribution of contributors according to the template “Data Marketplace”: each provider evaluates the price of its data or services

Governance mechanisms allow to adapt these rules (See next section).

## Data Space Governance

Data Spaces are commons governed in a decentralized way.

The governance of a data space details who can participate and the membership mechanisms.
It is possible to create roles with restricted rights.  

The governance precises the public or private nature of a Data Space. A public Data Space is reachable by anybody and a private one needs mechanisms of invitation or request of adhesion.

Besides, each Data Space decides what are the governance mechanism to change the rules. For instance, it can be a process of proposition and vote by all the members of the Data Space.

Note that the decentralized governance of the OKP4 Protocol still allows users to create centralized Data Spaces. Indeed, the governance of a Data Space can be in the hands of one or several chosen or elected members.

:::note

In a nutshell, the governance of a Data Space defines the following:

- The visibility of the Data Space (public or private)
- The nature of participants
- A set of rules that organizes _life_ in the Data Space (the conditions of access, the operations that are allowed or prohibited)
- A rules amendment process
