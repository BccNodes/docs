# Insurance & Sybil control

## Insurance

We will provide insurance to all builders in case of interrupted workflow during knowledge creation. In case a service/dataset is instantly withdrawn, the knowledge creator will be reimbursed on the full amount he paid.

## Sybil control

A Sybil attack is a type of security threat on an online system where a person tries to take control of the network by creating multiple accounts, nodes or computers. Attackers may therefore be able to vote against honest nodes on the network to refuse to receive or transmit blocks, thus blocking other users on the network. In very large-scale Sybil attacks, where attackers manage to control the majority of the network's computing power, they can conduct a 51% attack. This gives them the ability to change the order of transactions or even reverse the transactions made.

The dPoS (delegated proof-of-stake) mechanism we have ensures that it becomes very expensive for an attacker to attack our network with a Sybil attack. Our staking requirements provide a defense against such attacks. Votes are weighted by the amount of "stake", which are tokens that are locked to a node. This way, the number of nodes created by the attacker does not matter, because if the stake is spread over several nodes, they each have very little voting weight. This significantly increases the cost of attacking our network, as an attacker would have to buy an overwhelming quantity of tokens to stake.
