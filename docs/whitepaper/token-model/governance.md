# Governance

Governance will be done in KNOW. Staked KNOW holders can vote. All proposals require a minimum KNOW deposit. For each proposal (if the minimum deposit amount is reached), voters may vote to accept or decline.
Several cases:

- If the proposal is accepted by the majority, the deposited KNOWs will be returned to their owners
- If the proposal is rejected by the majority, the deposited KNOWs will be returned to their owners
- If the proposal is rejected with a veto (33%), the deposited KNOWs will be burned
- If the deposit amount is not reached (by passing the proposal pool), the deposited KNOWs are returned to their owners
