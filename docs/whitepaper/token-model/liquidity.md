# Liquidity

When the token is launched, the liquidity associated supply will be locked. This liquidity will be used for decentralized exchanges and for centralized exchanges in order to have a KNOW/ATOM & KNOW/OSMO pair at first.

In order to ensure our back-up we have a part of the DAO treasury wallet that can be used to provide liquidity for a given period of time if needed.

In addition we will be able to provide liquidity for all new Data Space governance tokens on OKPSwap so that they can be traded under the best conditions.
