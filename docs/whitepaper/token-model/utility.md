# Utility

KNOW is the native token of the OKP4 blockchain and are the only staking token of our ecosystem. They are a license for the holder to validate, delegate to other validators or vote. KNOW tokens can also be used to pay for transaction fees. Additional inflationary KNOW and block transaction fees are rewarded to validators and delegators.

<br/>

### Rewards

According to the adopted business model, KNOW tokens are at the center of our economy and will be the common currency. Indeed, they allow first of all builders to pay for the creation of knowledge as well as to remunerate all providers to the creation of this knowledge (data, algorithms and resource providers).

<br/>

### Transaction Fees

Transaction fees on the OKP4 blockchain will be paid in KNOW. These fees will go to reward the validators and delegators who keep the network running.

Transaction fees will be relatively low as validators are fairly incentivized thanks to the block reward. They will be variable, depending on the size and type of the transaction.

In addition, each Data Space will be able to add an additional transaction fee for each transaction within that Data Space if it wishes (governance).
