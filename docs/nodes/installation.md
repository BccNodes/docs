### Prerequisites

- `go` ‚Äî OKP4 is built using [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) version 18+. Install `Go` `1.18+` following instructions from the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- `make` ‚Äî the project comes with a convenient `Makefile` so verify that [`make`](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make) is properly installed.
- `git` ‚Äî in order to clone the project you need to have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

### Steps

Clone the [okp4/okp4d](https://github.com/okp4/okp4d) repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:okp4/okp4d.git
cd okp4d
```

Install `okp4d` using the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
make install
```

You can verify that everything is OK:

```bash
okp4d version
```

You should get an output similar to:
